# SUBSETS
- Permutations and Combinations
- Subsets -> Non-adjacent collections

In mathematics, a subset is a collection of elements that are all contained within another set. The formula to determine if one set is a subset of another set is as follows:

Let's consider two sets, A and B.

A is a subset of B if every element in A is also an element in B.

The subset formula can be written as:

A ⊆ B

In words, this can be expressed as "A is a subset of B" or "For every element x, if x belongs to A, then x also belongs to B."

Alternatively, you can use set notation to define a subset:

A ⊆ B if and only if (for all x) (x ∈ A → x ∈ B)

Here, "x ∈ A" means "x belongs to A" and "x ∈ B" means "x belongs to B". The arrow symbol (→) represents an implication, indicating that if the left side is true (x belongs to A), then the right side must also be true (x belongs to B).
