# Sorting:

### 1. Bubble Sort:
- Bubble sort also known as Sinking Sort/ Exchange Sort.
- Bubble sort also known as inplace sorting algorithm.
- It's a stable sorting algorithm.

Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n) => array is already sorted
- Worst Case: O(n^2) => arry is descending order or whatever.

### 2: Selection Sort:
- As the name suggest selection sort is select an element an insert it's correct position.
- There are two ways select an element: min or max element.
- This algorithm is good for small size of the array.

Time Complexity:
- Worst Case: O(n^2)
- Best Case: also O(n^2)
