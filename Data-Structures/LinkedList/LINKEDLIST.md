# Here are some common `Linked-List` patterns that are often tested in coding interviews:
1. **`Iterating through a linked list`:** This pattern involves traversing the linked list, either from the head or tail, and performing some operation on each node.
2. **`Two-pointer technique`:** This pattern involves using two pointers, one fast and one slow, to traverse the linked list. The fast pointer moves two nodes at a time while the slow pointer moves one node at a time. This technique is useful for detecting cycles in a linked list, finding the middle node, and other operations that require two nodes to be compared.
3. **`Reverse Linked List`:** This pattern involves reversing the order of the elements in a linked list. This pattern can be useful when you need to process the linked list in reverse order, or to solve certain problems that are easier to solve in reverse order. This can be done iteratively or recursively.
4. **`Merge Linked Lists`:** This pattern involves merging two linked lists into one. This pattern can be useful when you need to combine two sorted linked lists, or to create a new linked list by merging nodes from two different linked lists. This can be done iteratively or recursively.
5. **`Detecting cycles in a linked list`:** This pattern involves detecting if there is a cycle in a linked list. This can be done using the two-pointer technique mentioned earlier.
6. **`Removing duplicates from a linked list`:** This pattern involves removing duplicate nodes from a linked list.
7. **`Splitting a linked list`:** This pattern involves splitting a linked list into two separate linked lists. This can be useful for divide and conquer algorithms.
8. **`Finding the kth element from the end`:** This pattern involves finding the kth element from the end of a linked list. This can be done using the two-pointer technique mentioned earlier.
9. **`Traversing a Linked List`:** This pattern involves iterating through a linked list node by node, usually using a while loop. This pattern can be useful when you need to process each node in the linked list, for example, to print the elements or to perform some computation on each element.
10. **`Slow/Fast Pointer Technique`:** This pattern involves using two pointers to traverse the linked list at different speeds. The slow pointer moves one node at a time, while the fast pointer moves two nodes at a time. This pattern can be useful when you need to detect loops or find the middle node of a linked list.
11. **`Recursive Approach`:** This pattern involves solving problems recursively, by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved using the same approach. This pattern can be useful when you need to traverse a linked list in a recursive manner, or to solve problems that require backtracking or memoization.
