# Sorting:

### Bubble Sort:
- Bubble sort also known as Sinking Sort/ Exchange Sort.
- Bubble sort also known as inplace sorting algorithm.
- It's a stable sorting algorithm.

Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n) => array is already sorted
- Worst Case: O(n^2) => arry is descending order or whatever.

### Selection Sort:
- As a name suggest you going to select an element and put it at right position. 
- It is done by two ways: select max element and put it correct position or select min element and put it correct position.
- It's not stable.
- It performs well on small size arr.

Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n^2)
- Worst Case: also O(n^2)
