# Sorting:

### 1. Bubble Sort:
- Bubble sort also known as Sinking Sort/ Exchange Sort.
- Bubble sort also known as inplace sorting algorithm.
- It's a stable sorting algorithm.

Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n)
- Worst Case: O(n^2)

### 2. Selection Sort:
- As the name suggest selection sort is select an element an insert it's correct position.
- There are two ways select an element: min or max element.
- This algorithm is good for small size of the array.

Time Complexity:
- Worst Case: O(n^2)
- Best Case: also O(n^2)

### 3. Insertion Sort:
- Insertion sort basically means we are sorting the array partially.
- It's a stable sorting algorithm.
- Used for smaller value of N. Where array is partially sorted.

Time Complexity:
- Worst Case: O(n^2)
- Best Case: O(n)

### Cyclic Sort:
- `When given numbers from range(1, N) use Cyclic Sort.`
- Ex:
   1. You given numbers 1 to N, find the messing number.
   2. You given unsorted array find smallest or positive messing number.
   3. You given numbers 1 to N, find the duplicate number.
